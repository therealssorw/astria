# Astria — Godot 4.7 third-person action game

## File organization (IMPORTANT)

Being organized is very important in this project. Within reason, the more
folders the better — the more specific, the better. If a folder has more than
5 things in it that are not very similar (or wouldn't make sense grouped
together), it must be broken down into new subfolders.

Current structure to follow and extend:

- `Assets/` — all imported content
  - `Animations/Humanoid/` — animation FBX clips, grouped by purpose
    (`Combat/LightM1`, `Combat/HeavyM1`, `Combat/Blocking`, `Movement/Idle`,
    `Movement/Walking`, `Movement/Running`, `Movement/Sliding`, ...)
  - `Models/` — `Entity/Humanoid/Human/` for characters, `World/Islands/...`
    for level geometry; skeleton bone maps live in `Models/Entity/Humanoid/`
  - `Textures/` — mirrors the model grouping (e.g. `Humanoid/Human/Rouge/`)
- `scenes/` — .tscn scene files
- `scripts/` — GDScript, grouped by domain: `entities/` (player, enemy,
  character visuals), `ui/` (HUD), `world/` (level/world logic)

When adding new assets or code, place them in the most specific folder that
makes sense; create new subfolders rather than letting a folder grow into a
mixed pile.

## Technical notes

- Rendering: GL Compatibility; physics: Jolt. Main scene: `scenes/world.tscn`.
- The Rouge character (UE Manny rig) and the Mixamo animation clips are made
  compatible via import-time retargeting: each FBX's `.import` file references
  a BoneMap (`bonemap_manny.tres` / `bonemap_mixamo.tres`) mapping the rig to
  Godot's SkeletonProfileHumanoid. If an FBX is moved or reimported fresh,
  that `_subresources` retarget config in the `.import` file must be restored
  or animations will break.
- Rouge's textures live in `Assets/Textures/Humanoid/Human/Rouge/` (not next
  to the FBX), so `rouge_visual.gd` binds them to surfaces at runtime by
  matching material names to texture filenames.
- Gameplay numbers (speeds, damage, stamina, slide/lock-on tuning) are
  `@export` vars on `scripts/entities/player.gd` and `enemy.gd` — tune in the
  editor, not by hardcoding.
- Attack swing timings derive from the actual clip lengths at montage rates
  (light 1.35x, heavy 1.15x) via `rouge_visual.get_attack_info()`; a punch
  must finish before the next combo punch starts (queued input chains at
  swing end).
- Headless validation: run the Steam Godot binary with `--headless --import`
  then `--headless --quit-after 120` to catch script/scene errors.

## Multiplayer

- Boot flow: main scene is `scenes/ui/main_menu.tscn` (username + host/join).
  All networking lives in the `Net` autoload (`scripts/core/network_manager.gd`):
  ENet host/join, UPnP port mapping (so hosts don't need manual port
  forwarding; falls back to LAN with a message), the server-authoritative
  player registry (usernames, kills, deaths) and the entire RPC protocol.
- Never trust the client: the server simulates ALL combat (stamina, swing
  timing, hit traces, health, deaths, kill credit) on its copy of each pawn.
  Clients only send attack *requests* and cosmetic state reports; position
  reports are speed-validated (`Player.net_report_state`) and teleports are
  snapped back. Stats exist only in the server registry (`Net.players`),
  replicated read-only — the scoreboard (hold P) and inventory read those.
- Pawn roles in `player.gd`: owner (is_local) simulates + reports, server
  validates + runs authoritative combat for every pawn, everyone else gets
  an interpolated puppet. Enemies (`enemy.gd`): AI runs only on the server;
  clients get puppets spawned/driven through Net. World containers:
  `World/Players` and `World/Enemies`; spawn point = `scripts/world/
  spawn_point.gd` on the island Marker3D (group "spawn_point").
- Dedicated server: separate export preset "Windows Server" (custom feature
  `server`) -> `build/AstriaServer.exe`; it auto-hosts headlessly (see
  `build/run_server.bat`). Any build also accepts `--server [--port=N]`,
  and clients accept `--username=NAME --host / --join=IP[:PORT]`.
- Exports: presets in `export_presets.cfg`; templates installed under
  `%APPDATA%\Godot\export_templates\4.7.1.stable.steam`. Export with
  `--headless --export-release "Windows Client|Windows Server" <path>`.

## Workflow

- Always commit after a prompt. Every completed prompt should end with a git
  commit capturing the changes made during that prompt.
